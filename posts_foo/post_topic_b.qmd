# Intro
This posts discusses topic B, which is boring.

# Should we borrow content from other topics?
Let's bring over some content about topic A, which is known to be interesting.
Specifically, there's a section with some code, which I believe is super cool.
Let's use Quarto's `include` feature:
(will it render?)
{{< include /posts_bar/post_topic_a.qmd#code-example >}}

What if we try using underscore in filename?
(will it render?)
{{< include /posts_bar/_post_topic_a.qmd#code-example >}}
